# Web-Design-Challenge

This is an HTML code for a webpage that displays a comparison of various weather parameters (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed) with latitude.

The page has a navigation bar at the top, which includes links to different pages. There are four dropdown links to plots of different weather parameters, and a link to the "Comparison" page, which is the current page.

The page content is contained within a white background container with a header that reads "Comparison: Latitude vs X". The page displays four plots, each in its own column, with a header that describes the weather parameter being plotted. Each plot is clickable and takes the user to a separate page with more in-depth analysis of the selected parameter.

At the bottom of the page, there is a footer with a dark background.
